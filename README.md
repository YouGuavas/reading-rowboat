## Sonic's Adventure
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using scss for styling. 

I built this project for my partner's young child who is learning to read, and who loves Sonic. My intent was to build a choose-your own adventure style story with vocabulary that is challenging-yet-attainable for his reading level, and to attempt to teach some aspects of emotional intelligence in so doing.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
